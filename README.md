# SMART_GATE_KEEPING
Developed an automated system for managing vehicle entry and exit at gates using image processing and deep learning techniques. The system captures images, classifies vehicle types, recognizes license plates, and logs entry-exit data efficiently.

Key Responsibilities:

System Development and Integration:

Built a comprehensive vehicle entry-exit system utilizing deep learning and image processing.
Deployed the system on Google Colab, providing an intuitive interface for capturing or uploading images and logging vehicle data.
Data Preparation and Model Training:

Collected and preprocessed image datasets for various vehicle types.
Trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Keras and TensorFlow for accurate vehicle classification.
Implemented data augmentation techniques to enhance model robustness.
License Plate Detection and Optical Character Recognition (OCR):

Utilized OpenCV for detecting and extracting license plates from images.
Employed EasyOCR for accurate reading of registration numbers, handling rotated and skewed plates effectively.
Data Logging and Management:

Automated the logging of entry and exit times, vehicle types, and registration numbers into a CSV file.
Ensured data integrity and efficient record-keeping for vehicle management at entry gates.
Technologies Used:

Deep Learning: Keras, TensorFlow
Image Processing: OpenCV
OCR: EasyOCR
Data Management: Python, CSV
Deployment: Google Colab
